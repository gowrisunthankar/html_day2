    <!-- Difference between HTML Tags and Elements? -->
    =>HTML tags- Tags are the starting and ending part of an HTML element. They begin with “<” symbol and end with “>”. Whatever written inside < and > are called tags. For instance:--<b></b>
    =>HTML elements – Elements enclose the contents in between the tags. They consist of some kind of structure. It generally consists of a start tag, content and end tag. For instance: --<b>Content</b>

    <!-- Explain <br /> tag? -->
    =>The <br> tag in HTML document is used to create a line break in a text. It is an empty tag which means it does not need end tag like </br>.
        It is generally used in poem and address where the division of line is necessary.

    <!-- Explain how many different types of lists we have in html  -->
    =>There are 3 types of lists in HTML
    Unordered List: An Unordered list is used to create a list of related items, in bulleted or unordered format. It starts with the <ul> tag, followed by the <li> tag to show list items inside <ul> tag. 
        diff style:
            circle: It gives a circle list item marker.
            square: It gives square as list item marker.
            disc: This is the default filled circular bullet item marker.
            none: This is used to unmark list items.

            Ordered Lists: The Ordered lists have an order which is either numerical or alphabetical. The <ol> tag is used to create ordered lists in HTML
                The various ways to use the ordered list:
                    type = “1”: List will start from 1.
                    type = “A”: Here the list will start from A.
                    type = “a”: Here the list will start from lowercase a.
                    type = “I”: The list will start from Roman numbers.
                    type = “i”: TheList will start form lowercase Roman numbers.

            Description List: A description list is a type of list where each item has a description. It is also known as a definition list.
                <dl>: It defines the start of the list.
                <dt>: It defines a item.
                <dd>: It defines the description of each item.
